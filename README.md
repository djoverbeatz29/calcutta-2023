This is a React-based App I plan to build, with assistance from ChatGPT. Here is the initial prompt I sent, along with the response:

I am trying to develop a full-stack AWS React app that does the following: 1. Stores a list of golfers in a database, along with some fields (Name, Value, Team) 2. Makes an API call to fetch their data 3. Displays the name of the golfer on the screen, along with a dropdown list with three team names ('Front Row', 'Bonodoco', 'Street Sweepers'), a box that accepts integer values, and an enter button. 4. When the enter button is clicked, the golfer's back end info will be updated: the Team field will be assigned the team name from the dropdown, and the value will be assigned the integer entered in the box. How would I accomplish this task?

To develop a full-stack AWS React app that can store, retrieve and update data for golfers in a database, you will need to follow these general steps:
1.	Create an AWS database to store golfer data. You can use Amazon RDS to set up a relational database (such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle), or Amazon DynamoDB to set up a NoSQL database.
2.	Create an API in AWS Lambda or EC2 that can interact with the database and retrieve golfer data. You can use Node.js or any other suitable programming language to write the API code.
3.	Create a React front-end that can display golfer data and allow users to update the golfer's team and value fields. You can use the Axios library to make API calls from the React app to the API you created in step 2.

Here is a general outline of how you could implement the above steps:
1.	Create the database and define a table schema for golfers with the Name, Value, and Team fields.
2.	Write an AWS Lambda or EC2 function that can retrieve the golfer data from the database. This function should be invoked by an HTTP GET request to a specific API endpoint.
3.	In the React front-end, create a component that can display the golfer data. This component should use the Axios library to make an HTTP GET request to the API endpoint defined in step 2 and retrieve the golfer data.
4.	Create a form within the component that allows users to update the golfer's team and value fields. This form should include a dropdown list with three team names, a box that accepts integer values, and an enter button.
5.	Write another AWS Lambda or EC2 function that can update the golfer data in the database. This function should be invoked by an HTTP PUT request to a specific API endpoint.
6.	When the enter button is clicked, the React component should use the Axios library to make an HTTP PUT request to the API endpoint defined in step 5. The request should include the updated team and value fields for the golfer.
7.	Once the golfer data is successfully updated in the database, the React component should display a success message to the user.

These are the general steps for creating a full-stack AWS React app that can store, retrieve and update data for golfers in a database. The specific implementation details will depend on the chosen AWS services and programming languages.
